            <p class="message"><b>CRITICAL SECTION</b></p>
                <br>
                <br>

            <p>TA critical section is a specific area of code or a region of a program
where common resources (such variables, data structures, or devices) are
accessed and modified by several processes or threads (in concurrent
programming and operating systems). The concept of the critical section
is used to guarantee that only one process or thread can run this portion
at once, avoiding race situations and preserving data consistency.
The critical section problem occurs in systems with multiple
processes or threads because multiple concurrent processes or threads
may attempt to access the same shared resources at the same time. This
can result in difficulties like data corruption, race situations, and other
concurrency-related concerns if it is not controlled effectively.
To ensure mutual exclusion in the critical section, synchronization
mechanisms are used. Common synchronization techniques include:
A <b>mutex</b> (also known as mutual exclusion) is a lock that only
permits one process or thread to access the crucial portion at once. A
process must obtain the mutex before proceeding to the vital area. The
requesting process will be stopped until the mutex is released if it is
already being held by another process.
An integer variable called a <b>semaphore</b> is used to manage access to
shared resources. It can be utilized to permit just a specified number of
threads or processes to enter the vital region at once</p>
            <br>
            A mutex, condition variables, and shared data are all combined into a
monitor, which is a higher-level synchronization architecture. It
guarantees that only one process or thread can carry out <b>the monitor</b>
operations at once, making it simple to synchronize access to shared
resources.

            <p class="tourify">Critical Section Problem in Operating System</p>



                <br>
The section of a program known as the Critical Section attempts to
access shared resources. Any resource in a computer, such as a memory
region, data structure, CPU, or any IO device, could constitute that
resource.
            <br>
            <br>
The operating system has trouble authorizing and preventing
processes from entering the critical part because more than one process
cannot operate in the critical section at once.
A set of procedures that can guarantee that the Race condition among
the processes will never exist are designed using the critical section
problem.
            <br>
            <br>
Our main objective is to resolve the critical section problem in order
to synchronize the cooperative processes. In order to satisfy the
following requirements, a solution must be offered
            <br>
            <br>
            A Critical Section is a section of code that must be run in one atomic
operation that accesses shared variables. It means that just one process
must be doing its crucial portion at any given time in a group of
processes that are cooperating. Any subsequent processes must wait until
the first one is finished before beginning their key sections. The wait()
and signal() functions are primarily responsible for controlling the entry
into and exit from the crucial region.
<br>
            <br>
<b>Section : Entry</b>
ï‚· The method primarily asks for entry into the important part in
this section.
            <br>
<b>Section : Exit</b>
The crucial section comes after this one.
The remedy for the Critical Section Issue
The following three criteria must be met by a solution to the critical
section problem:
